## Inspiration
Intense emotions about AI

## What it does
It can sort a user's Spotify playlist to allow smoother transitions between differing genres and audio features. Additionally, it can detect the emotional expressions of a user's face and choose songs that reflect their mood. During this process, it adds mood light to further the effect. 

## How we built it
By gluing together a lot of different frameworks that shouldn't have been put together. 

## Challenges we ran into
Anita does not know how to use Python. JavaScript frameworks don't work synchronously half the time while requiring synchronous operation. Libraries only support dependences from 2 major versions ago. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Reverse engineering an LED strip. It actually works. 

## What we learned
The discovery of a curse involving Canyon Creek where any SD card that enters the building will cause a BSOD on any computer they are inserted into.
